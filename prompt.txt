Prompt / Specification for “Rejoda” Website (to feed to agent / developer)
1. General Guidelines & Technical Stack

Use vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no React) or a framework like Next.js without React parts or a simple static site generator, but avoid React complexity.

Use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger / ScrollSmoother plugins to handle scroll animations, smooth transitions, pinning, etc.

Use SVGs / vector animations / Lottie where possible for scalable and crisp visuals.

Prioritize performance: lazy load images, minimize layout shifts, and keep animation CPU usage moderate.

Use CSS variables (custom properties) for theme colors, spacing, typography to make styling consistent.

Responsive design: all animations and layouts must work gracefully on mobile, tablet, desktop. Use media queries and conditional scroll triggers for small screens.

Accessibility: make sure keyboard navigation, focus states, alt text on images, sensible tab order, and no traps caused by animations.

Use ScrollSmoother for overall smooth scrolling and parallax effects. 
GSAP

Use ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations like pinning, scrubbing, transitions.

2. Global Animation / Scroll Behavior

Wrap your content like this:

<body>
  <div id="smooth-wrapper">
    <div id="smooth-content">
      <!-- all sections here -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- fixed / overlay items like nav can be outside or pinned -->
</body>


Initialize:

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, ScrollSmoother);

ScrollSmoother.create({
  smooth: 1,
  effects: true,
  smoothTouch: 0.6,
  normalizeScroll: true,
});


Use data-speed or data-lag attributes on elements to create parallax or lag effects (e.g. data-speed="0.5") thanks to ScrollSmoother. 
GSAP

For sections where you want the border radius effect (edges rounding as user scrolls), use clip-path or inset() animations instead of animating border-radius (better performance) 
GSAP
+1

Use ScrollTrigger with pin: true and scrub: true to pin a section during scroll, create layered transitions (cards sliding over each other), and snap behavior. 
GSAP

3. Color / Style / Visual Theme Suggestions

Choose a modern palette (e.g. dark/navy + accent (teal, gold, or medical green) + white or light backgrounds).

Use soft shadows, rounded corners, smooth gradients.

Use micro-interactions: hover effects, subtle motion, SVG path drawing, line animations, and reveal transitions on scroll.

Use typography scale: e.g. H1, H2, H3 consistent sizes, line heights, responsive adjustments.

4. Page Layouts & Section-by-Section Animation Ideas

Below is a suggested structure and animation behavior for each page.

🏠 Index / Home Page

Hero Section

Full-screen hero with background (image, gradient, or subtle pattern).

On scroll, the edges of the hero container begin rounding (clip-path inset expands) turning into a card-like panel, then fully transitions to next section.

Use a layered effect: headline, subheadline, CTA fade/slide in with scrub scroll.

Possibly pin the hero for a moment, then release into main content.

Services Snapshot / Divisions

Three or more service cards (IT, Medical, Warehousing). Each card enters from different direction (left, bottom, right) with stagger.

On hover, slight scale, shadow, color shift.

Project Previews / Featured Work

Horizontal or full-width scroll, with each project sliding over the previous (stacking effect).

As you scroll, each project “card” pins momentarily, then transitions.

Use images + titles + short descriptions.

SVG Animated Blocks / Illustrations

Use SVG icons (e.g. server, medical cross, warehouse) that animate on scroll: paths drawn, morph, color transitions.

E.g. an SVG line drawing that animates as you scroll into that section.

Testimonials / Partner Logos

Fade-in + reveal from bottom.

Use clip-path reveal masks.

Call-to-Action Banner

Bold CTA with background/overlay animation (gradient shift, slight parallax movement).

Footer

Include minimal animation (hover states on links, icons, scroll-to-top arrow with animation).

ℹ️ About Us Page

Top Banner / Intro

Title + tagline with initial fade / slide animation.

Possibly background SVG shapes that move gently on scroll (slow parallax).

Founders / Team Section

For each founder: side layout — left side an SVG frame or device mockup, right side text (name, role, bio).

On scroll, the left SVG mockup “reveals” a photo or animates into portrait.

Use ScrollTrigger to trigger that reveal when that section enters view.

Vision, Mission, Values

Use reveal animation on each item (icon + heading + text).

Use scrub or staggered timelines.

Timeline / Milestones (optional)

Horizontal timeline where as user scrolls, markers or cards slide or fade in.

Or “progress bar” that moves as user scrolls.

Why Rejoda / Why Choose Us

List of bullet features with small hover or scroll animations (e.g. icons sliding, text fading in).

SVG / Decorative Elements

Use abstract shapes or lines that animate (scale, rotate) in background.

🧾 Projects / Case Studies Page

Intro / Header

Title reveal.

Project Cards / Panels

Each project as a full-section panel.

Use the “scroll over” effect: as you scroll, new panel slides over previous, or previous slides away (stack effect).

Pin each panel briefly to allow text and images to animate in (text from sides, images fade/slide).

Inside Each Case Study (optional deeper page)

Problem / challenge → approach → outcome.

Use scroll-triggered animations: charts animate, numbers count-up, elements fade or slide in.

Use SVG diagrams mocked to animate lines/paths.

Navigation / Side Indicators

A little indicator or progress bar to show which project you are on as you scroll.

📬 Contact Page

Contact Hero / Intro

Big heading (e.g. “Let’s Build Together”), with text sliding in.

Background shape or SVG that gently animates (parallax or wave shape).

Contact Form + Info

Form fields appear with staggered animation (label, input, button).

On focus states, fields animate border / underline.

The contact info (address, email, phone) fades in from sides.

Map / Location (optional)

Embed map + reveal animation (map zoom or fade).

Perhaps overlay shape mask on map, then unmask on scroll.

Footer / Back to Top

Animated arrow, hover effects.

5. Example Animation / ScrollTrigger Pseudocode Snippets
// Border radius / clip-path effect on hero
gsap.timeline({
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: ".hero-section",
    start: "top top",
    end: "bottom top",
    scrub: true,
    pin: true,
  }
})
.fromTo(".hero-wrapper", {
  clipPath: "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)"
}, {
  clipPath: "inset(10% 10% 10% 10%)",
  ease: "none"
});

// Parallax speed effect using ScrollSmoother
// if element has data-speed attribute
// e.g. <div class="layer" data-speed="0.5">...</div>

// Pin & slide cards
let panels = gsap.utils.toArray(".project-panel");
panels.forEach((panel, i) => {
  ScrollTrigger.create({
    trigger: panel,
    start: "top top",
    end: () => "+=" + window.innerHeight,
    pin: true,
    pinSpacing: false,
    scrub: true
  });
});

// Reveal founder photo into mockup
gsap.timeline({
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: ".founder-section",
    start: "top 80%",
  }
})
.from(".founder-mockup svg", { scale: 0.8, autoAlpha: 0 })
.from(".founder-text", { x: 50, autoAlpha: 0, duration: 0.6 });


You can build more timelines like this for each section. 
Then in the end you can use npm run build to bundle the project. so make sure the programing language you use allows that
